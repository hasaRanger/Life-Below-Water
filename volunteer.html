                <p>Volunteering with Coral Reef Restoration in Australia was a dream come true! The diving sessions were well organized, and I got hands-on 
                    experience in planting corals. Seeing marine life up close was pure magic! The staff was highly supportive and cooperative, and I befriended 
                    friends from all over the globe. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in ocean conservation!<br><a href="#">See more</a></p>

                <p>I volunteered for the Mangrove Forest Restoration project in Kenya, and it was great! We planted thousands of mangroves, which guard the 
                    coastline and provide a home for marine life. Our guides were knowledgeable and made sure we understood the importance of what we were doing. 
                    It was rewarding to see the effects of our work firsthand.<br><a href="#">See more</a></p>

                <p>The Costa Rican Sea Turtle Conservation experience was one of a lifetime. We patrolled the beach every night, safeguarding turtle nests from 
                    poachers and predators. It was heartwarming to see baby turtles crawl out of their eggs and run into the sea. But night shifts were long, 
                    and the heat and humidity were hard to handle at times. Still, I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat!<br><a href="#">See more</a></p>

                <p>I did volunteer with Ocean Cleanup in LA and helped clear plastic waste off Santa Monica Beach. Felt great doing something for the community, 
                    and seeing the tonnes of trash they were picking up really made me realise things. The downside was that they could have managed with more 
                    bins and spades. However, a good initiative, and I'd do it again.<br><a href="#">See more</a> </p>
